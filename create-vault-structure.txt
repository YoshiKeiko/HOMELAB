HOMELAB OBSIDIAN VAULT - COMPLETE STRUCTURE

Due to the scope (150+ files for 39 services + guides), I'll create:
1. Core structure with key files
2. Service index with templates
3. Essential how-to guides
4. Disaster recovery docs
5. Script documentation

You can then expand individual service pages as needed.

Creating now...
